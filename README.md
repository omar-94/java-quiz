Java Quiz is a fun little quiz that prompts the user with a series of questions when requested to start. Once the user has begun the quiz, a timer is set and runs until the quiz is over. Clicking through the answers the user will recieve feedback if right or wrong, and continue to the next question. If wrong, the user is penalized on the timer. If correct, the user is rewarded on their final score total. At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with their final score and the score is able to be saved to the console.log.
